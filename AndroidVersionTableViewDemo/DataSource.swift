    AndroidVersion(category: "Candy", name: "Marshmallow", version: 6, image:"Marshmallow", details : "Android Marshmallow introduces a redesigned permission model: there are now only eight permission categories, and applications are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is now used, in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions (such as the ability to access the camera or microphone) to an application when they are needed. Applications remember their permission grants, and they can be adjusted by the user at any time. The new permission model will be used only by applications compiled for Marshmallow using its software development kit (SDK), while all other applications will continue to use the previous permission model. Marshmallow also has a new power management scheme named Doze that reduces the level of background application activity when the device determines that it is not being actively handled by its user, which, according to Google, doubles the device's battery life.[8] It also introduces an option for resetting all network settings, available for the first time on Android, which clears network-related settings for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular connection. Android Marshmallow provides native support for fingerprint recognition, allowing the use of fingerprints for unlocking devices and authenticating Play Store and Android Pay purchases; a standard API is also available for implementing fingerprint-based authentication in other applications. Android Marshmallow supports USB Type-C, including the ability to instruct devices to charge another device over USB. Marshmallow also introduces verified links that can be configured to open directly in their specified application without further user prompts. Version of the Android API provided by Marshmallow is 23. The Android Marshmallow developer tools are available in the SDK Manager under the API level MNC")]
